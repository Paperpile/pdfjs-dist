# PDF.js

PDF.js is a Portable Document Format (PDF) library that is built with HTML5.
Our goal is to create a general-purpose, web standards-based platform for
parsing and rendering PDFs.

This is a pre-built version of the PDF.js source code. It is automatically
generated by the build scripts.

For usage with older browsers/environments, without support for modern features
such as e.g. `async`/`await`, and `ReadableStream`, please see the `es5` folder.

See https://github.com/mozilla/pdf.js for learning and contributing.

# Note
- This is distributable version of files built from (MetaPDF.js)[https://github.com/Paperpile/metapdfjs]. These files are copy of those that are generated inside of `metapdfjs/build/dist` when we build (MetaPDF.js)[https://github.com/Paperpile/metapdfjs].
